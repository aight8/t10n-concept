# t10n Rapid Application Prototype

Because the HackerNews API and Ruby on Rails is relatively new for me but especially because the app is heavily realtime based, I decided to rapid prototype the whole logic in a plain node.js app with live CLI output. The focus was on the issue: "how to manage to get the top 10 newcomers on the best way trough the API" - and was isolated from the rest of other issues which campe up in a ruby backend / react frontend architecture.

This package runs in the CLI and in the browser also.

The React frontend application reuse parts of this package.
@TODO: describe which parts

However here are the usual information about this package:

# Prerequirements

- current node.js version

# Run

```bash
yarn start
```
